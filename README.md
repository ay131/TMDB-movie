# TMDB-movie

In this project, we are going to investigate the TMDB movie datasets

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected fromThe Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue.
Certain columns, like ‘cast’and ‘genres’, contain multiple values separated by pipe (|) characters.
There are some odd charactersin the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry about cleaning them. You can leave them as is.
The final two columns ending with “_adj” show the budget and revenue of the associated movie in terms of 2010 dollars, accounting for inflation over time.
