# TMDB-movie

In this project, we are going to investigate the TMDB movie datasets

Data source :  https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv

This data set contains information about 10,000 movies collected from The Movie Database (TMDb),including user ratings and revenue.

● Certain columns, like ‘cast’
and ‘genres’, contain multiple
values separated by pipe (|)
characters.

● There are some odd characters
in the ‘cast’ column. Don’t worry
about cleaning them. You can
leave them as is.

● The final two columns ending
with “_adj” show the budget and
revenue of the associated movie
in terms of 2010 dollars,
accounting for inflation over
time.
